# Queuing System for Passport Office

Our Queuing System for Passport Office project is intended to test or demonstrate the behavior of queuing and client survival at passport offices. It works for both priority and multi-server processes. Our aim is to manage the waiting time and service time on counters using queuing theory steady state measures of performance. Queuing theory is the study of queues of waiting lines. The method is efficient to manage tickets at a fast pace because some of the analysis that can be derived using queuing theory include the expected waiting time in the queue, the average time in the system, the expected queue length, the expected number of people served at one time, the probability of balking public, as well as probability of system to be empty or full.


## Feartures and Component

Our project has two main components or modules, one deals with manual values while the other deals with mean values which are briefly discusses.

## Mean values by Mu and lambda:
This module uses lambda and Mu as inputs together with time to run a simulator. The system then generates all the performance indicators and graphs necessary to display the behavior of queuing and customer survival.
## Manual values (Customer Information):
This module's system manually inputs client information and then uses that information to produce results, checking behavior in the same way as the mean value module.

The system generates certain graphs and other objects to display the outcomes.

Server utilization and idle time: For this, a pie chart is created to display the servers' utilization and free time ratios.

Number of waiting customers: It is a card that displays how many customers are currently waiting during a simulation.

Generate Table: This table displays all the data for each attribute that is used to simulate events, such as arrival time, turnaround time, and service time.

Bar Graphs: It is used to graphically display all clients' turnaround times, waiting times, response times, and service times.
